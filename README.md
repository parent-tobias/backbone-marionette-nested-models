This tutorial will be part of a larger work, taking the process of building a complex, nested, single-page app with Backbone and Marionette. The purposes of this particular step are:

* To introduce the target
* Examine how models or colletions are nested within other models using Backbone
* Examine how the logic of the model can inform the logic of the view design
